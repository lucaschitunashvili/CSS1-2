                <p id="animals">
                    Did you know some animals and plants can glow in the dark? This cool trick is called
                    bioluminescence. It happens when a special chemical reaction inside their bodies creates light. It’s
                    like nature’s version of neon lights!
                </p>
                <p id="works">Here's how it works:</p>
                <ol id="ol-second">
                    <li>A molecule called luciferin mixes with oxygen.</li>
                    <li>An enzyme called luciferase helps speed up the process.</li>
                    <li>Voilà! A glow appears, but without heat – it’s called “cold light.”</li>
                </ol>
